"No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2. Pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. Wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. No pouch provided.5. Worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. Other person keeps complaining about my voice.

"i bought itfor 999,I purchased it second time, gifted first one to brother. This is really good.Sound quality is really good.You can connect 2 devices at a time.I connect laptop and mobile both.when listening muaic on Lappy, if u get a call, it switches to mobile,this switch between device is not good but again in this price its awesome.Battery stand by is 36 hours for me, and i have used it continously for 8 hours in one go.

"I can’t get enough of this earphone! The bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. The battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. The fact that I can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better. I use my earphones a lot for voice calls and this doesn’t let me down at all.  This is a must buy for all music lovers.

"Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

"Received this BoAt 255 earphones yesterday evening.Sound quality is perfect. Good combination of Bass and treble. Can feel every beat.Connectivity is quick. Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

"The product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent Bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.Sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.Durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightBattery life (3.5/5)- It has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.Connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangeCall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. Sometimes the call gets distorted.

"Below average product. Not happy at all.Pros : good sound qualityCons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. Bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.Battery life is just ok. Once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minLittle heavy on earsNo return possible
",boAt Rockerz 255,2024-12-23
"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

"First thing first, there is no bass at all only shrill treble. Bluetooth connectivity breaks down beyond 3 meters while it's falsely claimed that it has a range of10 meters. Absolutely no proof of them supporting bluetooth version 5 as claimed on the website . Chinese product with a lot of exaggerated claims.Last but not the least, the headphones have a very poor in ear grip and keep falling out despite the extended over the ear additional support. Changing the earbuds also doesn't help solve the problem.Returned them for them being very ordinary headpu that couldn't provide any real listening pleasure.

Now, it charges but has simply stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money on this product.

"The earphones are of good quality, was looking for earphones in budget, have tried boult space but these are much better, the bass as per the name is perfect, the vocals are also clear and overall the sound is pretty good compared to 'boult space' in which you hear only bass and no vocals. The only thing which i didn't liked was the distortion at full volume but that much volume is not safe for human ear, For better experience keep the volume at 75%.The ratings are below :-Bass - 4.5/5Vocals - 4.5/5Fit - 5/5Bluetooth range - 4.5/5Battery - 4/5

"The sound quality is nice at this rate..... But problem is with the battery..... In half n hour it came down from 50% to 20% and at 20% started saying that the battery is down and within one minute the the headphones got switched off which is extremely poor performance by the battery moreover the only indicator is when the battery is charging that from red colour it turns into blue colour but it does not auto cut off which is why you never know when it is fully charged or not....... Now waiting for after sales services since it has a 1 year warranty will have to see what and how fast is the services after sales...... Will update once any update comes from the manufacturer

"This is a typical ""let's make a fool out of Indians"" product ... and I am a ""foolish Indian.""Here are a few facts about this product: It is made in China, like every other Indian product is. And on the streets of Shenzhen, you will find this product for less than INR 100. 150 tops. At that price, this would have been a 5 star product. But, at about INR 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has NOT gone through quality control.Let's see what all is wrong with the product: The biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. What do I mean? See the attached photo. Those are two ear plugs that go over the RIGHT side of the headset! Two!! Putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! Why is that a problem? Because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. Putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!Issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.Issue #3: Are you driving? Are you jogging? Are you in a typical Indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? Nope! You can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.So, why didn't I return it? Because:1. I am a typical Indian who likes to be made a fool of by Indian companies,2. I am lazy,3. I just didn't want to wait for Amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.Overall, I lost INR 700 by being a typical Indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some Indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.Bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. I wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

Samsung says battery is 10 hours, I get 12 hours. Range is commemdable. Around 40mtrs easily. Looks good. Sounds good. Dual drivers, expected nothing less. only con is, the. wires are a bit on thinner side. But Samsung warranty policy is nice. They just replace your product with a new one.

"I purchased this product in Oct 2018. But started using this only after November 2018.It lasted hardly 2 months. By 5th January 2019, the following happened:+ The right earbud stopped working.+ The volume automatically started going down, even though the volume was set to max in the device (my phone) and this bluetooth device+ Often started to disconnect frequently - It was like it was having a mind of its own+ I successfully connected with two devices. But almost always one of them gets automatically disconnected after 3-4 hours. We need to re-connect this manually+ Noise cancellation is not there. So, if I talk in a crowded place, the other party will not be able to hear me clearly as there would be disturbance along with my voice tooMy suggestion: For the amount of money spent, this is definitely not worth. Please try out something else other than this. This product is only for people who have money to burn without expecting any returns.

"Sound quality is awesome, I am a frequent traveller of train & bike, I love active noise cancelation, no interruption of BT connection & battery life great. Comfy piece, yes It takes 2 3 days to get comfy with ear piece as it is heavy & big but one can get familiar with it very soon. Only draw point is earpiece cable robustness. Very thin & breakable cable used for both ear piece. It may get broken on very slight pull. Please be careful. Else excellent.

"This is one of the best earphone I have ever used. Quite comfortable to use with superb quality sound. With samsung level app you can customise the sound effect to your liking. All the battery backup is very good and will easily survive a whole day of usage.

"Waste of money. Amazon had marked it as under return / refund but when I asked for refund they denied and instead offered me replacement. When product is a crap what we will do with replacement. Endless issues with this product:- very frequently disconnect- Ear piece are very heavy- many issues while using it on laptop- can't take calls reliably through laptop- voice issue while on laptop
